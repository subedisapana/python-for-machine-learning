    "In this learning, the model is trained on the labeled dataset,  where the desired output or variable is already known.\n",

    "The primary objective in supervised learning is to minimize the discrepancy or difference between the predicted outputs generated by the model and the actual or expected outputs provided in the training data. This discrepancy is often quantified using a loss or error function that measures the dissimilarity between predicted and actual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labeled dataset used for training typically consists of pairs of input and \toutput data, where the input data is fed to the model, and the model produces an output prediction. The difference between the predicted output and the actual output is measured using a loss function, which quantifies the error between the predicted and actual output.\n",
    "\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer system is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning there is no predetermined output or target variable. Instead, the system is left to find patterns, structures, and relationships within the data on its own. The main goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data, without any prior knowledge of what those patterns might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several __types of unsupervised learning techniques__, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clustering__: This involves grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dimensionality Reduction__: This technique involves reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Anomaly Detection__: This technique involves identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Association Rule Mining__: This technique involves identifying relationships between variables in a dataset, such as items frequently purchased together in a market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is used in a wide range of applications, such as customer segmentation, image and speech recognition, and anomaly detection in cybersecurity. It can also be used as a preprocessing step for supervised learning tasks, to help identify important features in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. __The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative reward over time__.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the agent observes the current state of the environment, takes an action, and receives a reward based on the action taken and the state of the environment. The agent's objective is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a better view, lets assume a robot is navigating a maze to reach a goal position. The sensor fitted serves as a input device that detects and provides information about the presence of obstacles in the robot's surroundings. It can be of any type; sensors, cameras.\n",
    "The collected information is relayed to the robot's control system, which may include reinforcement learning algorithm, such as moving and changing directions, based on obstacles.\n",
    "The reinforcement learning algorithm defines a reward system to encourage robot to learn the optimal policy for navigation. For instance,\n",
    "If robot reaches the goal position, it receives a positive reward.\n",
    "If the robot collides with an obstacle, it receives a negative reward.\n",
    "During the training process, the robot witll explore the possible paths in the maze, and the reinforcement learning algorithm will update the robot's policy based on the observed rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important concept in reinforcement learning is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The agent needs to explore the environment to learn about the rewards associated with different actions, but it also needs to exploit its current knowledge to maximize its reward. Balancing exploration and exploitation is a key challenge in reinforcement learning.\n",
    "Reinforcement learning has been used in a variety of applications, such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. It has also been used to develop algorithms for optimizing complex systems, such as energy management systems and supply chain management."
